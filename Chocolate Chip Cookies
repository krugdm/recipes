=INGREDIENTS=
1 stick butter (½ cup or 113 grams), room temperature
75 g light brown sugar
125 g white sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp/5 ml vanilla extract
175 g flour
1/2 tsp/2.5 ml salt
1/2 tsp/2.5 ml baking soda
160 g (roughly 1 cup) chocolate chips
80 g (roughly 1/2 cup) chopped nuts of your choice (optional - I use pecans)

=DIRECTIONS=
With a mixer, cream the butter and sugars together. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until everything is smooth and incorporated.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda until they're all incorporated, too. Then start slowly folding that mixture into the wet ingredients.

Add the chocolate chips and nuts after that dough is done.

I like to wrap them up in plastic wrap and then let the dough rest in the fridge overnight, but you don't have to. Either way, you want to make sure the dough is at room temperature before you pop them in the oven.

I use a one-ounce scoop to measure out twelve perfect little dough balls on a sheet pan.

Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit/205 degrees Celsius for ten minutes on the middle rack of your oven.

I like to finish mine with some flaky sea salt.

Makes about 20 cookies total.
